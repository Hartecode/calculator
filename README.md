A javascript calculator

This JavaScript Calculator was developed for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator">freecodecamp</a>. This calculator can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers. There is a option to clear the input field with a clear button. You can also keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output. I also added the option to view past mathematical calculations.
